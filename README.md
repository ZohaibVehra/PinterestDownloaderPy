Download images from Pinterest URL links into specified folder as PNGs


This simple python script will parse through a file stored at a hardcoded URL for a save path to save the files, then pinterest URLs to save the image from.
It will parse through each URL, scrape the html code, parse it for the image in its highest resolution, store the link in a debug text file in case of error
and save the image in the requested folder.


Will be edited in the future to make the hard coded path easier to change as well as proper instructions will be added.
